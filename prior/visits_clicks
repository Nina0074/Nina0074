Here's my query (I did page_url like):
select date(from_unixtime(hit_time_gmt) AT TIME ZONE 'America/Los_Angeles') as hit_time_pst,count(distinct visitor_session_id) as visits,count(distinct ivid) as visitors 
from dlprd.tax_src.fact_clickstream_psd
where tax_year='2021' and page_url like 'https://turbotax.intuit.com/lp/aff/wuspanish/?priorityCode=5760500000&cid=all_wuspanish-emjan_aff_5760500000%'
group by 1
order by 1;

This gets total visits to the page.

Then to get clicks I did this:
select date(from_unixtime(hit_time_gmt) AT TIME ZONE 'America/Los_Angeles') as hit_time_pst,count(distinct visitor_session_id) as visits,
    count(distinct case when ui_action = 'clicked' then visitor_session_id else null end) as click_visits
from dlprd.tax_src.fact_clickstream_psd
where tax_year='2021' and page_url like 'https://turbotax.intuit.com/lp/aff/wuspanish/?priorityCode=5760500000&cid=all_wuspanish-emjan_aff_5760500000%'
group by 1
order by 1;

So a total of 67 visits to the page and of those, 16 visits clicked on a link which implies abandonment rate is 76%

Then to see what they clicked on you can run this:
select ui_action,ui_object_detail,count(distinct visitor_session_id) as visits
from dlprd.tax_src.fact_clickstream_psd
where tax_year='2021' and page_url like 'https://turbotax.intuit.com/lp/aff/wuspanish/?priorityCode=5760500000&cid=all_wuspanish-emjan_aff_5760500000%'
   and ui_action = 'clicked'
group by 1,2;
